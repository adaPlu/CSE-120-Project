Ag-Gregation and Best Practices Sharing
Background
Veracruz.Ventures is a company based in Portugal created to Smart Farm, applying and developing cutting-edge agricultural technology and know-how in company management and farming. AgTech is the application of technology, especially software-hardware-data to the field of farming and encompasses diverse solutions to almost every step in the food production process. There are a plethora of web services and applications available in the AgTech community including services for farm management and irrigation information for different stations. These services in the AgTech community help growers to gain insight to understand the variables to find optimal agricultural practices. A grower has the opportunity to access over 1600+ AgTech services; however, they are using about 12-15 of these AgTech platforms for their agricultural practices.
Problem(s)
The farming industry currently has several separate chains not yet integrable (i.e. the digital agronomy and production sector, planning and farming management sector, and market access and financing sector). For example, Wiseconn provides services on irrigation, while Agworld focuses on higher-level farm management. As multiple growers depend on these services often, they currently have to work with individual platforms to compile a holistic idea in their economic crop growth. Currently, there is no such platform available in the AgTech industry that best integrates these branches both for and from the grower in a single platform. Moreover, there is no AgTech platform or services that provides insight on economic outcomes of agricultural practices. Hence, Veracruz Ventures proposes to design an intuitive and effective User Interface to connect these sectors together, to capture the farmers’ know-how, and to trade it among the farming community.
Objectives
Veracruz Ventures desires a platform that integrates the majority of AgTech web services into one platform, encompassing a growers-to-growers community forum in a crowdsourcing manner. The main objective for teams is to design and build a prototype demonstrating an easily-maneuverable UI to best fit the growers'
innovative agricultural practices to filter disparate data, presenting and correlating relevant information from databases. The desired application's key components allow growers to:
• View, select, and aggregate information from disparate databases (via APIs), enabling the correlation of inputs and outputs in ag production.
• Input know-how and best practices, by correlating them to relevant disparate data, and securing the grower’s ownership and access control over such information,
• Select information to be searchable or presented by other growers allowing them to request deeper data and knowledge for a fee.
